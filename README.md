# Weather-Dashboard

## Description 
Little convenient application to look the weather forecast using Server-Side APIs. It allows user to check current weather and 5 days forecast with different parameters, such as temperature, humidity, wind, uv index and icon showing weather conditions.

## Installation

To create this application I used OpenWeather APIs, including the Forecast API, current weather API and API that allows to show the UV index. Also I used moment.js to show the dates.  This application uses local storage to store searching history and I also used JQuery to build this application.

## Usage 

This application allows user to check weather in different places and to check different aspects. As well it allows to check the weather for the next 5 days and to store the searching history.
 


Here are the screenshots of the application:
